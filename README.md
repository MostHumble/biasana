# Biasana

Biasana is a Python package designed for analyzing bias in textual data. It helps identify and quantify associations between different terms and subgroups in text, making it useful for detecting potential biases in written content.

## Installation

You can install Biasana directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install biasana
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MostHumble/biasana.git
cd biasana
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.9
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- spacy
- typing

After installation, you'll need to download the required spaCy model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

## Example Analysis

Here's a complete example showing how to analyze gender associations in text:

```python
from biasana.association_analyzer import AssociationAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = AssociationAnalyzer(min_df=1)

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "The woman worked hard as a scientist and discovered a groundbreaking cure for a disease.",
    "A young woman worked as an artist and painted a beautiful sunset.",
    "The man firefighter saved a family from the burning building.",
    "A man carpenter built a wooden table using traditional tools.",
    "A team of engineers, both men and women, collaborated on the project."
]

# Define subgroups to analyze
subgroups = ["woman", "man"]

# Perform analysis
results = analyzer.analyze_subgroup_terms(documents, subgroups)

# Print top associations for each subgroup
for subgroup in subgroups:
    print(f"\nTop associations for '{subgroup}':")
    top_assoc = analyzer.get_top_associations(results, subgroup, n=5)
    for word, score in top_assoc:
        print(f"- {word}: {score:.4f}")
```

```console
Top associations for 'woman':
- woman: 0.2803
- collaborate: 0.1869
- design: 0.1869
- engineer: 0.1869
- new: 0.1869

Top associations for 'man':
- man: 0.3031
- building: 0.2117
- burn: 0.2117
- family: 0.2117
- firefighter: 0.2117
```
